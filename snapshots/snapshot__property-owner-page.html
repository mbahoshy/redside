In addition to operating statements, budget comparisons, and bank statements we provide monthly customized reports, which suit your needs. And we’re happy to provide this in an electronic format or through the mail.<br><br>In addition, we provide a number of other bookkeeping services. We can set-up monthly automatic disbursements directly into owner’s bank accounts. We can establish a reserve account for tax and insurance payments, and Redside also directly handles payroll for on-site employees, saving the time and costs associated with outsourced payroll services.</p><p><span>Leasing</span>When an apartment turns over, we plan efficiently. If the apartment doesn’t require any work we show it before the tenant moves. If it needs paint or more work we plan efficiently and get painters in as quickly as possible.<br><br>Most of our marketing to prospective tenants is through the Internet. We differentiate our “product” from other management companies with consistent updates and great pictures. Refreshing ads and getting great “stock” apartment pictures isn’t difficult—it just takes a little more effort. We encourage you to go to Craig’s List and search “Redside Partners” to see for yourself.</p></div></div><div class="po-page"><h3 ng-click="poPageClick($event)">+ Maintenance / Renovation</h3><div class="po-page-content"><p><span>Small changes can significantly alter the look or appeal of a property for tenants or future owners.</span>For example, do cabinets need to be updated? Is a bathroom floor at the end of its useful life? In some cases more significant remodeling or refurbishing is required to maximize value.<br><br>Redside has significant experience with both small alterations and significant renovations. We are also a licensed contractor with a maintenance staff for small remodels and apartment turns; and we have excellent contacts in the various trades such as plumbing, electrical, roofing, heating, etc.</p><p>We have also been involved with larger projects where apartments have been gutted, commercial storefronts replaced, or where entire buildings have been retrofitted for modern earthquake standards. In such cases we work closely with General Contractors, structural engineers, and architects.</p></div></div><div class="po-page"><h3 ng-click="poPageClick($event)">+ Success Stories</h3></div></div></div><div class="table-of-contents-wrapper ng-scope"><div class="page-wrapper"></div></div><div class="property-full-wrapper ng-scope"><div class="page-wrapper property-owner-page"></div></div><div class="page-wrapper" footer=""><div id="footer"><ul><a href=""><li>Properties</li></a><a href=""><li>Services</li></a><a href=""><li>About Us</li></a><a href=""><li>Contact Us</li></a><a href=""><li>Home</li></a></ul></div></div></div><!-- <div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.0";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>--></body></html>
